\begin{abstract}
Due to regulations a lot of the usable radio spectrum is restricted.
These restrictions are regulated per country and only small proportions of the total spectrum is available for use.
But since these free to use bands are currently used a lot, due to the increase of wireless usage all around the world, it becomes more  and more difficult to propagate a signal in these bands.
Therefore new techniques have come around, like cognitive radio.
Cognitive radio makes use of the restricted radio spectrum, by detecting if this spectrum is used at a certain moment.
Making a perfect detector is difficult, since most of these detectors are prone to errors.
In this document we describe an implementation of such a detector using GNU Radio, and analyse it's performance.
